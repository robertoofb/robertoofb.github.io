## What is ScireHub?

<Notation type="underline" color="yellow">Scirehub is a web application developed with Next.js and hosted on Supabase, designed to serve as a university repository for research articles from various academic disciplines. It allows users to explore different research categories and provides researchers with the ability to publish their own articles for dissemination within the academic community.





## My contribution to ScireHub
In the aerospace industry, <Notation type="bracket" color="yellow" padding="10px" strokeWidth="2">In the development team of this web application, my role was both designer and web developer. I was responsible for structuring and implementing key modules, including the homepage, category pages, and hero sections. Additionally, I ensured the proper integration with Supabase and developed TypeScript-based functions to facilitate the correct rendering and functionality of each page component.

```js
// Import Three.js library
import * as THREE from 'three';

// Create the scene
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// Create Earth (sphere)
const earthGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32);
const earthMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x0000ff });
const earth = new THREE.Mesh(earthGeometry, earthMaterial);
scene.add(earth);

// Create satellite orbit (line)
const orbitPoints = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 360; i++) {
  const angle = (i * Math.PI) / 180;
  const x = Math.cos(angle) * 3; // Orbit radius
  const z = Math.sin(angle) * 3;
  orbitPoints.push(new THREE.Vector3(x, 0, z));
}
const orbitGeometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry().setFromPoints(orbitPoints);
const orbitMaterial = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
const orbit = new THREE.LineLoop(orbitGeometry, orbitMaterial);
scene.add(orbit);

// Position camera and render
camera.position.z = 5;
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  earth.rotation.y += 0.01; // Earth rotation
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();

```
## How to write a code in JavaScript?

To write code in JavaScript, you only need a text editor and a web browser. Below is an example of a simple JavaScript program that calculates the escape velocity needed for a rocket to leave Earth:

```js
// Function to calculate escape velocity
function calculateEscapeVelocity(mass, radius) {
  const gravitationalConstant = 6.67430e-11; // m^3 kg^-1 s^-2
  return Math.sqrt((2 * gravitationalConstant * mass) / radius);
}

// Earth's mass and radius
const earthMass = 5.972e24; // in kilograms
const earthRadius = 6371000; // in meters

// Calculate escape velocity for Earth
const escapeVelocity = calculateEscapeVelocity(earthMass, earthRadius);
console.log(`Escape velocity for Earth is ${escapeVelocity.toFixed(2)} m/s.`);
```
To run this code:

Save it in a .js file or include it in a `<script>` tag in an HTML file.
Open the file in a browser or run it in a JavaScript environment like Node.js.
JavaScript's simplicity and wide-ranging applications make it an ideal starting point for beginners and a valuable tool even in advanced fields like aerospace.
